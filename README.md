# 🛒🛍️✨ L&K (Retail Clothing Store) Network System

## Status: Finished

## 👋🏼 Welcome to my project work!

This project was developed as a **university coursework** for the **Operating Systems** subject at **Óbuda University**, as part of the **Computer Engineering BSc program**.

It showcases infrastructure planning and documentation skills in a practical, scenario-based environment.

The **L&K Network System** project is a fictional computer network design created for a **retail clothing store**. It simulates the planning and implementation of a secure, scalable IT infrastructure suitable for a real-world business environment.
