# Flood Level Prediction for Hungary 🇭🇺 🌊

**Status:** 🔄 *Data collection in progress*

## 📌 Overview

Flooding is a major seasonal challenge in Hungary, particularly along the **Danube** and **Tisza** rivers, where many people live close to the water. Sudden water level rises can pose serious threats to homes, infrastructure, and communities.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can **predict water level changes 1–2 weeks in advance**, using publicly available **daily data from the Hungarian Water Directorate General**.

By issuing early warnings as water levels approach critical thresholds, the model will help people better **prepare for potential floods in time**.

## 🧪 Current Phase

- 🔍 Researching and exploring official data sources  
- 📥 Collecting and cleaning historical water level data  
- 🛠️ Planning feature engineering and model architecture  

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Implement predictive models for flood forecasting  
- Add support for **inland flood** and **drought risk** predictions  
- Create a **web-based interface or alert system**  
- Expand to other river systems and regions  

## 📁 Data Sources (planned)

- Hungarian Water Directorate General (OVF)  
- Historical hydrological datasets (open access)  
- Satellite and weather data (optional)

## 📌 Goal

Build a practical, open-source tool that supports **flood preparedness and early warning systems** in Hungary using modern AI techniques.
